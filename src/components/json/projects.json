As such, the concept of creating a \"desktop shortcut\" for software is uncommon; software is rarely downloaded from the internet.\n\nHowever, in some cases, like when compiling software from source, a package manager may not be used to install the application. This often means the application will make no attempt to integrate with the system's application launcher.\n\nIn these cases, Shortcut Maker makes it easy to integrate those apps. Rather than being forced to create a so-called \"desktop entry\" by hand, a user can use Shortcut Maker to configure how the application should appear in the system app launcher.",
